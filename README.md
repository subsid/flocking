## Fun little Flocking simulation with threejs.
- [Demo](http://subsid.github.io/flocking/dist/)
- Ship designs and some flocking behavior was taken from https://codepen.io/coaster/pen/QpqVjP
- Includes cohession, velocity matching, steering, and centering.
- Fun to see flocks come together even after random and high initial velocities.
